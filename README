Hello,

These are my public dotfiles. Feel free to use them for learning, but be
warned, that they might not work for you.

## VIM

1. Initialize vundle:

```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.config/vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

2. Link vimrc to ~/.vimrc:

```
ln -sf vimrc ~/.vimrc
```


PÃ¤ikest,
Priit Laes :)
